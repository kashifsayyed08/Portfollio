            <h3>Additional Information</h3>
            <p>In 2017, I successfully completed my 10<sup>th</sup> grade education from SMT PA Sodha Marathi High
                School, Navapur under the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. Building
                on this academic foundation, I enrolled in junior college in Anglo Urdu Junior College, Nandurbar the
                same year, focusing on the science field to delve into a deeper understanding of scientific principles
                and explore various disciplines.In 2017, I successfully completed my 12<sup>th</sup> grade education
                under the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. In 2019, I embarked on
                the next phase of my educational journey, enrolling in the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) program with a
                specialization in Information Technology at SKN Sinhgad Institute of Technology and Science, Lonavala.
                Over the next four years, I dedicated myself to a comprehensive curriculum, acquiring valuable insights
                and honing my technical skills. This transformative journey culminated in the successful attainment of
                my engineering degree from Savitribai Phule Pune University in 2023. From my foundational education
                under my both previous schools i.e. SMT PA Sodha Marathi High School and Anglo Urdu Junior College to
                the specialized training at SKN Sinhgad Institute of Technology and Science, each experience has played
